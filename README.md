# RustyScat

## Overview
pet project to learn rust, ultimate goal is to have a rust scaterring transform library

## Journal
- 28-01-2026 : Just loaded a wav file
- 30-01-2026 : automatic dl of mp3 sample, should first try to plot / compute spectrogram before playing with FFT

## TODO
- [x] Load an audio file
- [x] automatic download of a mp3 sample
- [x] load mp3
- [ ] extract signals
- [ ] generate spectrogram
- [ ] compute FFT
